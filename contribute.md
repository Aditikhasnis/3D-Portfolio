### Issue guidelines:

1. Initiate conversation with maintainer.
2. Provide a title along with details about the issue you wish to implement.
3. Recommended to make your own branch and apply the changes there.
4. Providing screenshots will greatly benefit your cause here.

### Note:

Do note that the entire program is based on the fact that we are working with three.js, so the maintainer will note if you have used a pre defined 3D library like vanta.js.
